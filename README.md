# Automated-Spectral-Clustering
This repo contains a part of the codes of the following paper:

Jicong Fan, Yiheng Tu, Zhao Zhang, Mingbo Zhao, Haijun Zhang. A Simple Approach to Automated Spectral Clustering. NeurIPS 2022.

Currently, the codes are not well documented. More codes will be uploaded later.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me (Jicong Fan: fanjicong@cuhk.edu.cn).

# Description
exp_YALEB is to run AutoSC-GD on the YaleB face dataset

exp_mnist_fmnist_GTSRB is to run AutoSC-GD on the large datasets (Tables 4 and 5)

autosc_gd is our AutoSC-GD algorithm (with only LSR and KLSR because they are efficient)

autosc_gd_nse is our AutoSC-GD algorithm (with only LSR and KLSR) with NSE for large datasets
